# B2B-B2C
## Trying to resolve e-commerce transportation issues

### Aim of the Application
The main purpose of creating this application is to use all the technologies that I have learned during the last four years comprehensively and to be fully prepared for all kind of actions that is required to create a complete application. 

Note that, I have used Microservice Architecture, Docker, Kubernetes, DigitalOcean, JavaScript, and TypeScript for application development.

![This application is publicly accessible through the GitHub repository](https://github.com/asmdhabibullah/b2b-b2c-cross-border)

### Used Technologies
- Docker
- Scaffold
- Kubernetes
- DigitalOcean
- JavaScript
- TypeScript
- Microservice Architecture


### Future target
Connect multiple county with the through of application based on the Gov. law

# How Works Our Client app
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) frontend project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for more details.
